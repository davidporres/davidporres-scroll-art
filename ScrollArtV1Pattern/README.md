## 1. Hashtag-Snake

`ScrollArtV1Pattern.java` is a program that prints a hashtag-snake going down the terminal. 
It creates a pattern that looks like a snake just moving around left and right. It's fully self-designed, so all credit goes to me :)


## 2. Text-moji Art 

My text-moji art is in `ScrollArtV1.java`.
I wasn't sure what to do for a while, so I just looked up random ascii art until a boat came to mind. I saw some pretty cool while also doable boats, and I decided to make that my project. The site I found them on doesn't let me credit the authors (as no authors are listed), but I took heavy inspiration from 2 boats under this archive: https://www.asciiart.eu/vehicles/boats

#### Process 
The boat was very similar to one that I found on the archive, with a few slight changes that I thought would look better. The water and birds (*s) in the sky were personal additions that I thought would give more life to the scene. 

Then I input each individual character into its 2D location into Image.java, in the `getImage()` function.
